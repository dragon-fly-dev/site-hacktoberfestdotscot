    content: Brett I have worked in IT around 10 years and have been a System Administrator
      for around 3 of those years. I began learning Powershell as a means to automate
      dull tasks, mainly around Active Directory, and I caught the bug. I now spend
      most of my day either in VSCode or a Powershell console in some way shape or
      form.

      For my sins, I am a self-confessed Microsoft Fan Boy. I don’t know what else to say other than I think that the .Net Framework is a great platform to build on, and I really can’t get enough of it. I am a certified Microsoft Developer, and I am more than happy to talk at length about anything geek related, so if you have any questions, feel free to get in touch.

      In addition to coding, I love automating things. Especially around automated deployment of code, as well as infrastructure. Automate all the things!
