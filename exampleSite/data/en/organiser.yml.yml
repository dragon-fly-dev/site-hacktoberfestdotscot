      This will be my 5th Hacktoberfest that I have participated in and my 3rd year organising an event!

      I'm a Microsoft Cloud and Datacenter MVP and Microsoft Certified Trainer, a DevOps Engineer with a love of PowerShell, Automation, Chocolatey, Scottish single malt whisky and wireless earphones. I've given workshops and spoken at different events across the UK, Europe and the US. Being in IT for almost 30 years, I have a real passion for passing on knowledge and talking with aspiring techies.
